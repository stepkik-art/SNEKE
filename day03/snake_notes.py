    ''' 
    The display_surface has a function we can use called fill, which takes one color argument.  
    The act of using display_surface's fill is said as
    "Call display_surface's fill function and pass WHITE in as it's argument."
    It looks like this:  
    1. display_surface.fill(WHITE)

    # Blit HUD
    # TODO: Read below.  2 TODO's, require's explanation
    '''
    Blitting means copying an image from it's source (the code) to it's destination (the display) 
    This is necessary after updating the source (score changes, snake, and apple change etc.)
    1. "Call display_surface's blit function.  It takes 2 arguments, text and rect surrounding that text.  
    Pass in title_text and title_rect to blit the title to the screen
    2. repeat for a new call to display_surface's blit function passing in score_text and score_rect.  
    "We've just told the title and score to display.  
    '''



    # Blit assets
    # TODO: Read below.  2 TODO's, require's explanation
    '''
    Calling pygame.draw.rect is a way to blit rectangles.  
    The blit function for display_surface is for direct blitting.  
    2 ways to do similar things.  Update the display
    1. "Call pygame.draw.rect and passing in display_surface, GREEN, and head_coord for the head of the snake
    2. "Call pygame.draw.rect again pass in display_surface, RED, and apple_coord for the apple.

    # Update display and tick clock
    # TODO: Read below. 2 TODO's, require's explanation
    '''
    1. Now we update the display by calling pygame.display's update function passing in no arguments.
    
    2. The while loop we are in is super fast.  We actually need to slow it down to our FPS of 20 seconds.  
    That's what our clock variable will do for us.  What until 20 frames have passed every second.  Then continue.  
    This is ticking the clock.   
    to tick the clock call the clock object's tick function passing in FPS
