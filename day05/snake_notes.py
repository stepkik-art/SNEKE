    Blitting means copying an image from it's source (the code) to it's destination (the display) 
    This is necessary after updating the source (score changes, snake, and apple change etc.)
    1. "Call display_surface's blit function.  It takes 2 arguments, text and rect surrounding that text.  
    Pass in title_text and title_rect to blit the title to the screen

    Calling pygame.draw.rect is a way to blit rectangles.

    2 ways to do similar things.  Update the display
    1. "Call pygame.draw.rect and passing in display_surface, GREEN, and head_coord for the head of the snake
    2. "Call pygame.draw.rct again pass in display_surface, RED, and apple_coord for the apple.

    2. The while loop we are in is super fast.  We actually need to slow it down to our FPS of 20 seconds.  
    That's what our clock variable will do for us.  What until 20 frames have passed every second.  Then continue.
